# Homelab Automation

Hello,

You've found my homelab-automation repository. It is pretty specific to my workflows, but I've made it open-source because there may be some concepts or ideas that could be useful for others.

## Automation Workflow

This automation workflow is built around [Ansible](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/) and [ansible-pull](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/cli/ansible-pull.html). In a typical Ansible setup, you install Ansible on a single **Control Node**, which then runs [Ansible Playbooks](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_intro.html) against **Managed Hosts** to configure them as desired.

However, this approach assumes that Managed Hosts are always online and accessible, which isnâ€™t the case for most homelab workstations (desktops and laptops often sleep or are offline). This is where ansible-pull excels.

With ansible-pull, you install Ansible on each Managed Host. Each host then pulls the latest version of a repository (like this one) and applies the configuration itself. This ensures that even intermittently available machines stay up to date.

To get started, install the required packages and run ansible-pull as follows:

**Note:** The command below (along with many other things in this repository) has only been tested on Fedora and/or a recent version of an Enterprise Linux distribution (RHEL9+).

```sh
sudo dnf install python3-pip git wget
sudo python3 -m pip install ansible ansible-lint
sudo ansible-pull \
    --limit localhost \
    --directory /opt/homelab-automation \
    --url https://github.com/seantwie03/homelab-automation.git \
    $(hostname --short).yml
```
