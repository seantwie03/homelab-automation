#       - Split vs two instances
#         - Two instances allow tab switching on each instance
#           - two instances: gemini/servera on different tabs | slides/pnpm dev on different tabs
#             - Can mix/match
#             - Easier to switch (Win+ instead of Ctrl+Alt+)
#             - Able to have more than 2 "splits"
#             - Con: Workflow not replicable on Traditional DEs
#             - Con: New instances always open to ~
#             - Leaning toward this one
#           - vs
#           - kitty split: (gemini | slides) on a tab / (pnpm | servera) on a tab
#             - Con: Limited to two splits
#             - Con: More rigiid (both splits grouped on a tab)
#             - New splits open in same directory
